# Django todo list app
Here is a todo app created with the Django web framework, I created this app to explore and learn Django best practices and how to incorprate user specific content as thats what all my current Django Projects lack. I belived it would be easier to create a simple app and learn the methods and then incorporate them into other applications later. If you want to use this app live then you can do so by following [this](https://bens-todo-demo.herokuapp.com) link.

# Getting started
If you want to set up a local build of this app then you can simply clone this Repository and `cd` into `..\deploy todo\new_todo` and run the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`. This will automatically collect and install all the dependancies needed for this app to run. From there in the same directory run the command `python manage.py runserver` which will start the local development server.

From there you can use the application locally or tweak the code, if you are familuar to Django then you will know where to look and edit code but if you are new to Django, watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMG4r03G6g8) video which covers the basics of Django.
